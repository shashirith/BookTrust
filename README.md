## Features

- **Decentralized Ownership Tracking:** Utilizes Ethereum smart contracts for secure and transparent tracking of book ownership.
- **Reading Progress Management:** Allows users to update and track their reading progress for each book.
- **Efficient Book Retrieval:** Provides functions to retrieve finished and unfinished books for a user.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Implemented with ReactJS to offer an intuitive and seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Ethereum Blockchain:** The backbone of the system, ensuring transparency and immutability.
- **Solidity:** A programming language for smart contracts.
- **Alchemy:** A platform for blockchain infrastructure, ensuring a reliable connection to the Ethereum network.
- **Hardhat:** A development environment for Ethereum that aids in compiling and deploying smart contracts.
- **Ether.js:** A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **ReactJS:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm: [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Hardhat: Install globally using `npm install -g hardhat`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/decentralized-library.git
    ```

2. Change directory:

    ```bash
    cd decentralized-library
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Project

- Start the ReactJS front-end:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

- Deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum network:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network 
    ```

## Usage

The decentralized library system is easy to use. Users can add books, update reading progress, and retrieve book lists based on completion status through the user-friendly interface.

## Future Scope

- **Interoperability with Other Libraries:** Enable collaboration with other decentralized libraries.
- **NFT Integration:** Explore the integration of Non-Fungible Tokens for unique book representations.
- **Smart Recommendations:** Implement a recommendation system based on user reading history.
- **Mobile Apps and Accessibility:** Develop mobile applications for wider accessibility.
